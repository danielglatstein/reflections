how did viewing a diff btw two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

  it gave you an easy view to see the changes and line # it was on
  typing in 'diff -u' before made it happen 
  the '-u' made it easier to view

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

  more efficiently see changes
  more easily create collaborative branches in a project while moving fwd 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

  manually saving makes things more logical, and able to clearly label changes for diff functions
  auto save doesnt follow logic and makes it hard to collaboarate with other ppl

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

  git allows to track mult file changes b/c its meant for coding 
  and a lot of times diff files will reference eachother 
  and provide eachother w/ diff rules

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

  git log will show u the id of every commit 
  and then the written description of what changed
  git diff you can take two versions and it will show u the line change in each one and what was added/deleted

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

  scoping the problem becomes easier when u can see step by step what changed
  and seeing what line it was on

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

  to track changes/progress on dodgerredhead.nyc

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
  initializing a repo will tell git to track changes for the folder
  you need to tdo it to be able to to make commits to track changes as you begin changing the file
  but you need to push the files up to github to make the commit
  just initializing makes the file wai tin a place of limbo
