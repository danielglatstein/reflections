What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
  initializing a repo will tell git to track changes for the folder
  you need to tdo it to be able to to make commits to track changes as you begin changing the file
  but you need to push the files up to github to make the commit
  just initializing makes the file wai tin a place of limbo
